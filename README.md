## Instruction
This is the behavioral modeling implementation, just copy and build a new project upon these files, and you're good to go\
(remember to delete the .idea folder)
> wave.do
> 
is a wave window setup for you to get the same wave window as I have.\
How to get it ? <br/>
in the `transcript window` type<br/>
```do wave.do ```, hit `Enter`<br/>

## My Experience
**I strongly suggest everyone to start with behavioral first**, then move on to do the gate level if you have extra time.\
I tried to start with gate level and the code gone crazy with over 2000 lines, a control signal was off and it became impossible to debug.\
I literally cram the whole behavioral modeling and the report in one week, definitely not a good experience.<br/>

### Good luck, future CS 147 warriors! May the wires be with you.
